                                    <p>The Orcs were bred by Melkor in mockery of the Elves, sometime during the Great Darkness.[4][5] John Howe - Orc Swordsman It is unclear exactly when Orcs were created, but it certainly happened before the War for Sake
                                        of the Elves in his stronghold of Utumno. Whether the Orcs were at this time a capable fighting force against the host of Valinor is not known. But at least some of them survived this war, probably hidden in the
                                        deep vaults of Angband, and multiplied, waiting for their master. When Melkor (now known as Morgoth) returned to Middle-earth, he created new hordes of Orcs and invaded Beleriand, where the First Battle of Beleriand
                                        took place. Orcs also fought in Dagor-nuin-Giliath.</p>

                                <p>Through the Music of the Ainur, Ilúvatar created a Vision of the World, and explained much of its nature and destiny to them - so the Ainur have much knowledge of the World, but are not omniscient. Then Ilúvatar granted
                                    the World true being. Many of the Ainur desired to descend into it and form it in readiness for the coming of the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men).[1] Fourteen of these great Ainur became the Valar, or Powers of
                                    Arda.[2] The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that path and became known as Morgoth, the Dark Enemy.[3] The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar into Arda are known as Maiar.[4] Those Ainur who entered the
                                    World at its beginning remain bound to it until its end.[1] Though Melkor was eventually thrown into the Void by the others, he is prophesied to return before the end.[5] Little is known of the ultimate future of the
                                    Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that, after the great battle at the end of the World, they will make a Second, even greater, Music with the Children of Ilúvatar. The Ainur are angelic beings, nonetheless they
                                    do possess gender. Those who later descended to Arda took on common male and female forms to appear to the Elves in, and have an inherent male or female gender even when formless. This is because their gender is based
                                    on their being, which is independent of any physical form they may assume.[1]</p>

                                <p>They were originally the Men of the Mountains. Their people descended from the Pre-Númenórean peoples related to the Dunlendings and flourished during the Second Age. They had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years before
                                    the foundation of Gondor. After Gondor was founded, their King swore allegiance to Isildur and the Dúnedain in the last years of the Second Age. But when the time came for them to fulfil their oath, and fight beside
                                    Isildur against their ancient master, they broke their word; they refused to join the Last Alliance, and hid in the mountains. Isildur cursed them to remain without rest until their oath was fulfilled. Waiting for the
                                    Heir of Isildur to appear and grant them the chance to fulfil their word at last, they haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg. It was said that when their wraiths appeared in the valley of Harrowdale that lay in
                                    the mountain's shadow, also known as the Paths of the Dead, it was in times of trouble or death. In the War of the Ring, Isildur's Heir, Aragorn, called on the oathbreakers to fulfil their oath at last. They followed
                                    him through the Gondorian lands south of the White Mountains, and at the port of Pelargir they drove away the allies of Sauron in fear. For their aid, Aragorn granted them their freedom, and they vanished at last from
                                    the world.</p>

                                <p>Besides being considered more beautiful than men, Elves were also generally taller. Their hair colour varied; but the basic rules were that the Noldor generally had dark hair (brown or black), the Vanyar golden, and the
                                    Teleri silver or dark. Their eyes are usually described as grey. Their lives were counted to begin at conception rather than birth, and though their minds sharpened much earlier in life than in the race of Men, their
                                    bodies grew more slowly. They were considered fully-grown at about a century. They married usually only once in their lives, and their children were often few and far-between. Their most distinguishing characteristic
                                    from the Mortal races was the fact that they were invulnerable to age or disease; unless they were killed by sword or sorrow, they would live to the end of the world. Unlike Men whose fëar (spirits) left Arda when their
                                    bodies died, Elves' fëar were bound to Arda until its ending. If an Elf's hröa (body) died, its fëa would be summoned to the Halls of Mandos, where the Valar could re-embody the Elf in a hröa that was identical to the
                                    Elf's previous hröa. However, if an Elf committed evil acts during their lifetime and refused to repent, the Valar could delay the Elf's re-embodiment, impose conditions on it, or refuse it altogether.[5][6] An Elf
                                    could refuse the summons to Mandos or choose to remain disembodied,[5][7] but the Elf's houseless fëa would still be unable to leave Arda.</p>

                                <p>Throughout their history Hobbits had showed unparalleled skill, courage and also endurance and resistance in times of danger and terror. During their Wandering Days Hobbits demonstrated an easiness to adapt to the environments
                                    they visited and adopted the customs and languages of the peoples they were in contact with. In the Shire, they had settled with a closed and comfort-loving lifestyle; they were fond of an unadventurous bucolic life
                                    of farming, eating, smoking pipe-weed,[7] socializing and talking about genealogies. Hobbits also liked to drink ale in inns, and ate at least six meals a day when they could get them. Every Highday and after noon,
                                    Hobbits celebrated a small holiday with evening feasts. [8]</p>

                                <p>Ents were 14-foot tall creatures like humanoid trees with very thick skin resembling tree bark. They resembled the trees that they shepherded. An individual Ent more or less resembled the specific species of tree that they
                                    typically guarded or honored, to the point of the personality one might expect from that tree.[6] Thus they varied in height and size, colouring, and n number of fingers and toes. For example, Quickbeam guarded rowan
                                    trees and thus looked very much like a rowan. There were trees that were awake or half-awake, and some were entish and Ents could awake or talk with some of them. Treebeard aroused some Huorns to destroy Isengard.[15]
                                    Ents were dwelling in Ent-houses and were nourished by Ent-draughts. They were immortal (although they could be damaged or killed with sufficient force) and along with it, they were deliberate and slow in thought, decision
                                    and action. Their slow, long-winded language reflected this; of other languages they preferred Quenya, which they also spoke in an agglutinating, long-winded way like Entish.</p>
