The factions page has been included as I felt that this is an important aspect of any information data base as it gives the user a brief introduction to those races and factions that would be talked about so rather than a user seeking information from other sources and leaving the website, they can get that information direct. As a user I want to see as much information as possible and therefore the layout has been designed in such away that as much information can be taken in as quickly as possible, therefore the graphs have been made to a scale and sized in such away that four graphs can be seen at the same time. ","","## Features","","The nav-bar is an important feature and has been created using bootstrap.","","One of the features I have included is the onclick event targeted at the ring img, the idea behind this was to was to create an initial interactive feature that would draw in the user, on the click event the words slowly fade in as they do on the movie and in the books. This code was created using JQuery.","","```javascript","   $(\"#the-ring\").click(function() {","        $(\"#the-ring-quote-1st-line\").fadeIn(1000, function() {","            $(\"#the-ring-quote-2nd-line\").fadeIn(1000, function() {","                $(\"#the-ring-quote-3rd-line\").fadeIn(1000, function() {","                    $(\"#the-ring-quote-4th-line\").fadeIn(1000)","                });","            });","        });","    });","});","```","","The second set of features was to add modals targeting the images of the different races, this was done to allow more space or real-estate on the  screen by not having large elements taking up room. A Font Awesome icon (the information icon)  was also added to each of the main headings of each section, this was done for the same reason as above.","","I have a full picture display background using pictures that have been sourced from the internet this adds to the sense of character of the website. The coding for this is below.","","```css",".bg-realms {","    background: url(../images/elven-home.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;","    -webkit-background-size: cover;","    -moz-background-size: cover;","    -o-background-size: cover;","    background-size: cover;","    z-index: 1000;","    padding-bottom: 30px;","    width: 100vw;","    min-height: 100vh;","}","```",""," ","","Features also include the graphs themselves that have been rendered using d3, dc and crossfilter. This has allowed for information to be taken from a file source, in this case a csv file and then be rendered as an svg. These allow for a lot of interaction between data therefore allowing users to click on certain graph values, these will then be highlighted in other graphs.","","### Future Features","","These include more button functions that allow the user to access additional information in all sections, also the use of sub-categories in the Race section that allows the user to see more detail about the races, using sub-headings in drop-down menus.","","## Technologies","","-  JQuery  library- this allows for manipulation of the DOM speeding up the process of development, instead of using JavaScript ","","- D3.js - is a JavaScript library that allows the user to manipulate svg's using HTML and CSS","","- DC.js - is a library that allows you to access large datasheets and then render them using D3.js with pre-built charts","","- Crossfilter - allows these charts to be interactive and dependent on each other","","- JavaScript - is a programming language for HTML and with CSS is one of the main parts of the WWW","","- Bootstrap 3 - this allows developers to create well organised websites that are easier to position the HTML elements. It has a number of features such as the grid-system, positioning, mobile-responsive and many more","","     ","","## Testing","","The website has been tested for responsiveness using Google Chrome Development tools. It has been accessed using a mobile phone and an Ipad to see how the browser reacts to different browser sizes and it is fully functioning (however please not that svgs and d3, dc are not designed tobe responsive or to be used on small screens). This has been achieved through the use of Bootstrap 3 classes and media queries","","All graphs have been thoroughly tested for their responsiveness, if one aspect of a graph is clicked on the other graphs respond as they should. ","","// however there is a bug that has been thoroughly looked at and that is seemingly unknown for the cause of, when the two towers in the film section is clicked on both the two towers and the hobbit are highlighted. Any suggestions by developers would be very much appreciated the js can be found in movies.js.","","The ring click-event works on multiple browsers and in different browser settings.","","the faction/race list and its images work in multiple browsers and has been made responsive through the use of media-queries. ","","the graphs for the movie data have been adapted using JS so that they do not bring up the information in the data that contains all both trilogies information, as i felt that this went against the point of the highlighting the individual film data.","","An interesting bug was that some of the key, value pairs in the information had no information in them and therefore distorted the graphs, showing the information as a set of un-named values, this bug was overcome using js as shown in the code below.","","```javascript","function gender(ndx) {","    var dim = ndx.dimension(function(d) {","        if (d.gender === '') {","            d.gender = 0;","            return null;","        }","        else {","            return d.gender;","        }","    });","```","","##  ","","## Deployment","","Website was deployed using GitHub, to do this follow these instructions","","1.  go to the GitHib repository  ","2. under the repositories name click settings","3. go to GitHub pages (scroll down)","4. click on the drop-down menu under source and click on master branch","5. click save","","","","","","","",""],"id":20}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":14,"column":11},"end":{"row":14,"column":11},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1563397513641,"hash":"abbea990bc1cc4e4b3301b32f212d7d59ca04745"}
